In a prolonged conversation it usually gets better but I really wish I was one of those guys who could meet an attractive woman and be really funny and interesting straight off.

I’m not trying to objectify them - I know that the trick is to “just talk to them as if they were anyone else”. My problem is in the execution of that.

Everyone has something that they're going through that is difficult and you want to feel like you're not alone.  The good news for you is that you're all useless morons to us mods so that's comforting.\\n\\nBut coming to reddit to ask about mental health resources and how to improve your mental state is just plain stupid.  Like we get that you may think there is nowhere to turn, but there really is.  Literally any place on the internet is better than Reddit.  Reddit is a toxic shithole which will just draw you in further and make you more of an angry son of a bitch.  There's even [articles and research done on how shitty web forums are](https://scholars.org/contribution/countering-online-toxicity-and-hate-speech) and studies have shown that [anonymity like Reddit users have just make it worse](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2056305116664220).  If 40% of internet users have experienced online harassment, why would you trust the internet to fix your mental health problems?  \\n\\nWe get that you want to find a place where you feel like other people are going through the same stuff that you are, and there's honestly a lot of good in that.  But there are several established factors working against you on reddit:\\n\\n1) Most people here are making shit up to get reactions out of you.\\n\\n2) If they're not making shit up, they're trying to make you as miserable as they are so they can feel better about themselves.\\n\\n3) Reddit is a toxic shithole in general.\\n\\nWhile there are definitely some people here who want to get better, the majority don't.  They don't want you to feel good.  They want you to feel miserable because they think that making other people miserable will make them feel better.  \\n\\n**So from now on, Automod will automatically remove all posts about dealing with depression, suicide, and men's mental health.  Automod will also link a series of sites that either provide direct links to mental health counselors, or will point you to sites with mental health counselors in your country.**\\n\\nInb4 \"mods don't care about mental health\": we do care about mental health deeply.  Most of us either see therapists or have seen therapists in the past.  Which is why we recognize the value in seeing someone who is ACTUALLY TRAINED to help you, instead of listening to some unqualified rando on the internet.\\n\\nLove,\\n\\nThe mods\\n\\n**tl;dr mental health posts now banned, automod will link mental health resources in the removal.**</td>\n",

I'm at the point in my life where my friends are getting married/engaged, and struggling to find where the fine line is between being whipped and making compromises. My cousin talked for years about not wanting kids but now is going to have them because his fiance wants them. \\n\\nWhere in compromise/sacrifice do you guys draw the line on what is and isn't worth it? I know it's a case by case basis, but just curious how other people feel\n",

I’m far from perfect but one of the positive things I have going for me is I have the gift of the gab. I’m good at conversation and I like to think I’m quite witty. Except...\\n\\nI have no problem talking to girls I’m not attracted to, but I have some kind of mental block when it comes to a girl I am attracted to. My mind just goes blank and I can’t think of anything to say. What usually comes out is some kind of bland comment about the weather or something and it’s just painfully awkward. In a prolonged conversation it usually gets better but I really wish I was one of those guys who could meet an attractive woman and be really funny and interesting straight off. What annoys me is I know I can be funny and interesting, but for some reason I draw a blank when it comes to girls I’m into.\\n\\nAny advice on how to fix this?\\n\\nEdit:\\n\\nShould have mentioned - yes, I know that attractive girls are people too. I’m not trying to objectify them - I know that the trick is to “just talk to them as if they were anyone else”. My problem is in the execution of that. My mind just goes blank and I can’t think of what I would say to a normal person. It’s almost as if the normal, easy-going conversational bit of my brain just goes on holiday or something.\n",
       "5  MOD POST: On Mental Health Sup shitlords,\\n\\nWe as moderators understand that times have been tough on everyone.  Everyone has something that they're going through that is difficult and you want to feel like you're not alone.  The good news for you is that you're all useless morons to us mods so that's comforting.\\n\\nBut coming to reddit to ask about mental health resources and how to improve your mental state is just plain stupid.  Like we get that you may think there is nowhere to turn, but there really is.  Literally any place on the internet is better than Reddit.  Reddit is a toxic shithole which will just draw you in further and make you more of an angry son of a bitch.  There's even [articles and research done on how shitty web forums are](https://scholars.org/contribution/countering-online-toxicity-and-hate-speech) and studies have shown that [anonymity like Reddit users have just make it worse](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2056305116664220).  If 40% of internet users have experienced online harassment, why would you trust the internet to fix your mental health problems?  \\n\\nWe get that you want to find a place where you feel like other people are going through the same stuff that you are, and there's honestly a lot of good in that.  But there are several established factors working against you on reddit:\\n\\n1) Most people here are making shit up to get reactions out of you.\\n\\n2) If they're not making shit up, they're trying to make you as miserable as they are so they can feel better about themselves.\\n\\n3) Reddit is a toxic shithole in general.\\n\\nWhile there are definitely some people here who want to get better, the majority don't.  They don't want you to feel good.  They want you to feel miserable because they think that making other people miserable will make them feel better.  \\n\\n**So from now on, Automod will automatically remove all posts about dealing with depression, suicide, and men's mental health.  Automod will also link a series of sites that either provide direct links to mental health counselors, or will point you to sites with mental health counselors in your country.**\\n\\nInb4 \"mods don't care about mental health\": we do care about mental health deeply.  Most of us either see therapists or have seen therapists in the past.  Which is why we recognize the value in seeing someone who is ACTUALLY TRAINED to help you, instead of listening to some unqualified rando on the internet.\\n\\nLove,\\n\\nThe mods\\n\\n**tl;dr mental health posts now banned, automod will link mental health resources in the removal.**\n",
