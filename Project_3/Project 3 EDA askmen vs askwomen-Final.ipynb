       "      <td>My wife is getting chubbier... how do I find a healthy way to be honest and constructive? Sorry, this is kind of long...Before I start, I just want to say that I'm happily married. I love my wife to death. She really is everything to me and I can't imagine being this happy with anyone else.\\n\\nWith that being said, there is a glaring..issue? that I just don't know how to address which is obviously, given the post name, about her weight. Over the years has put on weight. Not a lot, but definitely a noticeable amount and to be clear, she is aware of this.\\n\\nMy wife has never been athletic for her entire life but was always fairly thin. If I'm being honest I've never liked how much she is opposed to exercise given that I enjoy it.  Also, the small things get really frustrating with how many items I have to carry for her. I know it's pretty normal for guys to carry their girls' stuff and in general, carry the heavy items which I do, but sometimes it's just a little more concerning than I'm comfortable with.  She can do it, but the sheer amount of effort it takes is really concerning. We plan on having children in the near future which is probably most concerning to me.\\n\\nOkay, enough complaining. My marriage isn't at any risk of destruction and as I said we are very happy together, but my question comes down to this. How have some of you managed this situation (If you have)? How can I go about telling her what I want to see for her (Which is healthy eating, and exercising routinely, with me preferably) without making her feel like crap about herself and also without pressuring her? I also understand that I cannot change her and that she has to want this for herself, but just simply... What can I do? Or should I do anything?\\n\\n\\*\\*\\*Update: Frist of all thanks to everyone who commented with some really great suggestions. The majority of the advice received was just about being honest, which I took as sound advice because it was the thing glaring me in the face. So as of this update, I decided to talk to her. I was honest with her and told her what thought and felt and it went over way better than I expected and she took it well and we have a plan to start Yoga together (which she was already considering). Also, I will be helping with cooking more, so it's a start and we'll see where it goes. Hopefully in the near future maybe I can update this again with some more good news\\n\\nSomethings to note for the future posters, my wife and I live in Korea so some ideas are simply not possible when it comes to certain foods. Also recently why wife had a health check and everything was fine with the exception of being a little overweight. Health standards over here are different. As I said in my original post, she is not obese she just put on the couple to the point where it's noticeable. The physical ability concern has been far more prevalent. Also, the possibility of having children perhaps was the most concerning to me, to which she understands and totally agreed with. Depression is something that she dealt with in the past and is something we actively manage together, but not necessarily the cause for weight in this particular case. I think it's simply eating habits and the gamer lifestyle. lol\\n\\nAlso to those who have said I should look at myself before saying anything to her: In the last year and a half I started working out regularly and have gained 25-27lbs to a point my wife liked (I was really skinny and insecure lol)  I know my metabolism is fast which made this situation really tricky because I know this could be easily misunderstood, but anyways I wanted to change my life in that. Of course with COVID that gym life for has ended, but now I'm about to get back into the game. I say this not because I just wanted her to follow me, but to give some context. I know it's freaking hard, but I also know it's worth it if you are the one who chooses to do it for yourself.\\n\\nThanks again, everyone. I still look forward to any future suggestions or stories that some of you offer. They are really interesting to me and I think helpful for anyone who is maybe in a similar situation.</td>\n",

       "      <td>How can I help my younger brother be more confident? I'm a 30 yo-something ~~dinosaur~~ and I live with my younger brother, who's turning 21. After having a bad couple of years being neglected by our parents, he moved in with me, he's been on a lengthy self-improvement journey, and I'm incredibly proud of him. He lost a lot of weight, his skin cleared up, and we've been doing lots of things together before lockdown hit last year. However, he's still very self-conscious, he doesn't talk if he can help it, and avoids people that he doesn't already know very well.  He said he'd like to be more outgoing, and sometimes plans things like going on hikes, but he seems to be fine with doing all of that with me or with a friend of mine he really likes and looks up to. I want him to live a young man's life and be social with people his own age though, once restrictions are lifted.\\n\\nAny idea or suggestion is welcome :)\\n\\n===\\n\\n***\\n\\nEdit a few hours and hundreds of comments later: So much good advice, it's hard for me to reply to every one who was kind enough to reply. I noted a few more things I haven't thought of, but I think that **martial arts** could definitely appeal to him (probably karate).\\n\\nWe'll talk this weekend about what he had in mind to be more outgoing and take it from there, depending on what's opened in our area and what he could get into little by little. \\n\\nA few things I just wanted to explain:\\n\\nI'm not a pushy person: I might come off like that in writing, English is not my mother tongue and I tend to be more direct in English ~~for work-related reasons~~. I don't force him to do anything, he said he wanted to be more outgoing and I wondered what young men who were in his shoes would have to recommend. \\n\\nI don't want him to be like me: I'm not the life of the party myself, but I'm 10 years older, we have different personalities even if we get along great, and I processed my own childhood abuse. We're at different stages of life, I cannot be his \"buddy\" - and I don't want to. That's why I wanted to ask here. A big sister is not a replacement of a group of friends his age with whom he can experience normal things.\\n\\n* Some of you were so nice by the way I wonder if he shouldn't make a reddit account and try to find friends who are also into bikes and whatever he decides to pursue.\\n\\nHe has a therapist: I suggested it when he left our parents' home, and he chose one after a few sessions here and there. Not sure exactly kind of therapy but after a few sessions he had \"homework\" to do. He got better since he moved in but if you have been around people who were neglected when they were kids, you know they \"absorb\" the neglect and my brother tends to see himself as helpless and gets in a sort of lethargy. Not his fault. \\n\\nHe had planned to move in last year with young people his age, among them, one that he met at work, but covid happened, the houseshare fell through, and he decided to wait it out. However, him moving out is definitely on the horizon :)\\n\\nOnce again, thanks for all the comments and tips. I have to go make dinner now!\\nAnd hug your siblings\\n\\n2nd edit: thanks a lot for the rewards, but I'm not sure what to do with them, maybe it's better to consider donating to an organization that helps abused/neglected children instead :)</td>\n",

I have been living with my girlfriend for several years and we have a young son. I have never felt any attraction towards other guys and the only thing that came close to sex with a guy was some fooling around when I was still in my teens. And I never gave that much thought and had almost forgotten about it. Recently I met this guy and we spend a lot of time just talking. Like me he has a girlfriend but he is 10 years younger than me. I realised that he is extremely good looking - in fact he was used as a model for a famous brand of underwear. He is funny, but can also be very deep and I really enjoy his company. The other day I was looking through his facebook photos and I started wondering whether I felt a sort of attraction towards him. I am feeling puzzled so I tried to think if there was anything sexual in what I was thinking. The thing is that I admire his body but I can't imagine having sex with him. For lack of a better word it is like I have a crush on him. It does not help that he sometimes goes on about sexual stuff like talking about his junk.\\n\\nI feel that I am now too old to be going through a phase where I start to question my sexuality.

We are so far off base and she’s changed so much (not for my better) that it’s time.  Papers get signed tomorrow.  I’m 29, great job, good health, cute pup, and I’ll have some income with the sale of our house.  I feel a pretty large weight lifting off of me, as I’ve been on the back burner for a very long time.  I’m trying to treat this like a complete life reset.  Meeting women isn’t a problem for me, at least it hasn’t been during the separation phase, I imagine it’ll be even easier once I have no baggage.  But what are some things or adventures you’d dream of going on or doing?  I’m pretty wide open and willing to try anything right now!  I think for once in my life I’m going to live for exclusively me for a bit.  Maybe disappear into the woods for a month haha.\\n\\nThanks!\\n\\nEdit addition: Ok, I feel like I need to clarify here on the getting girls comment.  (Which I changed girls to women since people have a problem with that) Honestly.. my self worth did diminish a ton over this.  The back story being.. my wife determined she’s gay.  All of the counseling, separations, talks, back and fourths, boundary pushing, hurtful conversations and behaviors really gets to you over the course of a 1 1/2 year stint.  On one hand, it’s great she figured it out for herself.  But it’s really left me feeling pretty inadequate and honestly ugly in many ways through this process.  Especially in the ways she handled it.  The pain of feeling not enough really stinks. Never mind the distance and lack of intimacy all while she begged to go out and be intimate with others.  When I downloaded apps to see, or just started asking for numbers during the separation, it really perked me up and made me realize that maybe I am desirable after all and worthy of someone who clicks with me on my level and can be compatible when I’m ready.  I felt very imprisoned in this.  I’m sorry I came off as a pompous ass.  I do have needs, I do want to mingle around.  But ultimately, I want to work on me, continue to grow be it mentally, and physically in the gym, and go on many adventures!  \\n\\nI will say this experience has shown me what questions to ask and things to work on when I am ready for something serious.  I’m 💯 in therapy and have been since the beginning of this process.  I also just had all my wisdom teeth pulled two hours ago and am handling all of this solo.  Because I’m a independent man, damnit.  I appreciate all of the thoughtful messages, and comments.  This is .. still tough and it comes in waves of highs and lows.  I ultimately just want to make lemonade from lemons and create the best life for me now.   Much brotherly love to all of you!</td>\n",

My ex girlfriend dropped on me out of nowhere that she was kicking me out, aborting our expected baby and my first child and wanted nothing to do with me and I really thought this would be the first time Id be able to hold a grudge and stick to it.

       "202  My wife is getting chubbier... how do I find a healthy way to be honest and constructive? Sorry, this is kind of long...Before I start, I just want to say that I'm happily married. I love my wife to death. She really is everything to me and I can't imagine being this happy with anyone else.\\n\\nWith that being said, there is a glaring..issue? that I just don't know how to address which is obviously, given the post name, about her weight. Over the years has put on weight. Not a lot, but definitely a noticeable amount and to be clear, she is aware of this.\\n\\nMy wife has never been athletic for her entire life but was always fairly thin. If I'm being honest I've never liked how much she is opposed to exercise given that I enjoy it.  Also, the small things get really frustrating with how many items I have to carry for her. I know it's pretty normal for guys to carry their girls' stuff and in general, carry the heavy items which I do, but sometimes it's just a little more concerning than I'm comfortable with.  She can do it, but the sheer amount of effort it takes is really concerning. We plan on having children in the near future which is probably most concerning to me.\\n\\nOkay, enough complaining. My marriage isn't at any risk of destruction and as I said we are very happy together, but my question comes down to this. How have some of you managed this situation (If you have)? How can I go about telling her what I want to see for her (Which is healthy eating, and exercising routinely, with me preferably) without making her feel like crap about herself and also without pressuring her? I also understand that I cannot change her and that she has to want this for herself, but just simply... What can I do? Or should I do anything?\\n\\n\\*\\*\\*Update: Frist of all thanks to everyone who commented with some really great suggestions. The majority of the advice received was just about being honest, which I took as sound advice because it was the thing glaring me in the face. So as of this update, I decided to talk to her. I was honest with her and told her what thought and felt and it went over way better than I expected and she took it well and we have a plan to start Yoga together (which she was already considering). Also, I will be helping with cooking more, so it's a start and we'll see where it goes. Hopefully in the near future maybe I can update this again with some more good news\\n\\nSomethings to note for the future posters, my wife and I live in Korea so some ideas are simply not possible when it comes to certain foods. Also recently why wife had a health check and everything was fine with the exception of being a little overweight. Health standards over here are different. As I said in my original post, she is not obese she just put on the couple to the point where it's noticeable. The physical ability concern has been far more prevalent. Also, the possibility of having children perhaps was the most concerning to me, to which she understands and totally agreed with. Depression is something that she dealt with in the past and is something we actively manage together, but not necessarily the cause for weight in this particular case. I think it's simply eating habits and the gamer lifestyle. lol\\n\\nAlso to those who have said I should look at myself before saying anything to her: In the last year and a half I started working out regularly and have gained 25-27lbs to a point my wife liked (I was really skinny and insecure lol)  I know my metabolism is fast which made this situation really tricky because I know this could be easily misunderstood, but anyways I wanted to change my life in that. Of course with COVID that gym life for has ended, but now I'm about to get back into the game. I say this not because I just wanted her to follow me, but to give some context. I know it's freaking hard, but I also know it's worth it if you are the one who chooses to do it for yourself.\\n\\nThanks again, everyone. I still look forward to any future suggestions or stories that some of you offer. They are really interesting to me and I think helpful for anyone who is maybe in a similar situation.   \n",

I'm a 30 yo-something ~~dinosaur~~ and I live with my younger brother, who's turning 21. After having a bad couple of years being neglected by our parents, he moved in with me, he's been on a lengthy self-improvement journey, and I'm incredibly proud of him. He lost a lot of weight, his skin cleared up, and we've been doing lots of things together before lockdown hit last year. However, he's still very self-conscious, he doesn't talk if he can help it, and avoids people that he doesn't already know very well.  He said he'd like to be more outgoing, and sometimes plans things like going on hikes, but he seems to be fine with doing all of that with me or with a friend of mine he really likes and looks up to. I want him to live a young man's life and be social with people his own age though, once restrictions are lifted.\\n\\nAny idea or suggestion is welcome :)\\n\\n===\\n\\n***\\n\\nEdit a few hours and hundreds of comments later: So much good advice, it's hard for me to reply to every one who was kind enough to reply. I noted a few more things I haven't thought of, but I think that **martial arts** could definitely appeal to him (probably karate).\\n\\nWe'll talk this weekend about what he had in mind to be more outgoing and take it from there, depending on what's opened in our area and what he could get into little by little. \\n\\nA few things I just wanted to explain:\\n\\nI'm not a pushy person: I might come off like that in writing, English is not my mother tongue and I tend to be more direct in English ~~for work-related reasons~~. I don't force him to do anything, he said he wanted to be more outgoing and I wondered what young men who were in his shoes would have to recommend. \\n\\nI don't want him to be like me: I'm not the life of the party myself, but I'm 10 years older, we have different personalities even if we get along great, and I processed my own childhood abuse. We're at different stages of life, I cannot be his \"buddy\" - and I don't want to. That's why I wanted to ask here. A big sister is not a replacement of a group of friends his age with whom he can experience normal things.\\n\\n* Some of you were so nice by the way I wonder if he shouldn't make a reddit account and try to find friends who are also into bikes and whatever he decides to pursue.\\n\\nHe has a therapist: I suggested it when he left our parents' home, and he chose one after a few sessions here and there. Not sure exactly kind of therapy but after a few sessions he had \"homework\" to do. He got better since he moved in but if you have been around people who were neglected when they were kids, you know they \"absorb\" the neglect and my brother tends to see himself as helpless and gets in a sort of lethargy. Not his fault. \\n\\nHe had planned to move in last year with young people his age, among them, one that he met at work, but covid happened, the houseshare fell through, and he decided to wait it out. However, him moving out is definitely on the horizon :)\\n\\nOnce again, thanks for all the comments and tips. I have to go make dinner now!\\nAnd hug your siblings\\n\\n2nd edit: thanks a lot for the rewards, but I'm not sure what to do with them, maybe it's better to consider donating to an organization that helps abused/neglected children instead :)   \n",

I am a man in my mid 40s. I have been living with my girlfriend for several years and we have a young son. I have never felt any attraction towards other guys and the only thing that came close to sex with a guy was some fooling around when I was still in my teens. And I never gave that much thought and had almost forgotten about it. Recently I met this guy and we spend a lot of time just talking. Like me he has a girlfriend but he is 10 years younger than me. I realised that he is extremely good looking - in fact he was used as a model for a famous brand of underwear. He is funny, but can also be very deep and I really enjoy his company. The other day I was looking through his facebook photos and I started wondering whether I felt a sort of attraction towards him. I am feeling puzzled so I tried to think if there was anything sexual in what I was thinking. The thing is that I admire his body but I can't imagine having sex with him. For lack of a better word it is like I have a crush on him. It does not help that he sometimes goes on about sexual stuff like talking about his junk.\\n\\nI feel that I am now too old to be going through a phase where I start to question my sexuality. Have any other adult straight men had similar experiences late in their life?\\n\\nEDIT: Hey guys and gals thanks so much for all the feedback - it is going to take me ages to read it all and also the private messages - I am sorry it is going to take some time to reply because I am not on Reddit everyday.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;   \n",

It feels like a life redo button, now what? After a very hard 1 1/2 years trying to work through things, my wife and I are finally divorcing.  We are so far off base and she’s changed so much (not for my better) that it’s time.  Papers get signed tomorrow.  I’m 29, great job, good health, cute pup, and I’ll have some income with the sale of our house.  I feel a pretty large weight lifting off of me, as I’ve been on the back burner for a very long time.  I’m trying to treat this like a complete life reset.  Meeting women isn’t a problem for me, at least it hasn’t been during the separation phase, I imagine it’ll be even easier once I have no baggage.  But what are some things or adventures you’d dream of going on or doing?  I’m pretty wide open and willing to try anything right now!  I think for once in my life I’m going to live for exclusively me for a bit.  Maybe disappear into the woods for a month haha.\\n\\nThanks!\\n\\nEdit addition: Ok, I feel like I need to clarify here on the getting girls comment.  (Which I changed girls to women since people have a problem with that) Honestly.. my self worth did diminish a ton over this.  The back story being.. my wife determined she’s gay.  All of the counseling, separations, talks, back and fourths, boundary pushing, hurtful conversations and behaviors really gets to you over the course of a 1 1/2 year stint.  On one hand, it’s great she figured it out for herself.  But it’s really left me feeling pretty inadequate and honestly ugly in many ways through this process.  Especially in the ways she handled it.  The pain of feeling not enough really stinks. Never mind the distance and lack of intimacy all while she begged to go out and be intimate with others.  When I downloaded apps to see, or just started asking for numbers during the separation, it really perked me up and made me realize that maybe I am desirable after all and worthy of someone who clicks with me on my level and can be compatible when I’m ready.  I felt very imprisoned in this.  I’m sorry I came off as a pompous ass.  I do have needs, I do want to mingle around.  But ultimately, I want to work on me, continue to grow be it mentally, and physically in the gym, and go on many adventures!  \\n\\nI will say this experience has shown me what questions to ask and things to work on when I am ready for something serious.  I’m 💯 in therapy and have been since the beginning of this process.  I also just had all my wisdom teeth pulled two hours ago and am handling all of this solo.  Because I’m a independent man, damnit.  I appreciate all of the thoughtful messages, and comments.  This is .. still tough and it comes in waves of highs and lows.  I ultimately just want to make lemonade from lemons and create the best life for me now.   Much brotherly love to all of you!   \n",

No matter how much someone screws me over or how mad I get, I always find myself forgiving and forgetting and resenting the fact. My ex girlfriend dropped on me out of nowhere that she was kicking me out, aborting our expected baby and my first child and wanted nothing to do with me and I really thought this would be the first time Id be able to hold a grudge and stick to it. Then as soon as shes nice to me again for the first time I tell myself \"I'm sure she had her reasons\" or \"She must have been struggling a lot\" and I'm back to being nice.\\n\\nThis is my most recent example but this is an ever too common theme of my life, I just forgive and forget even when I dont want to, and I guess I'm just hoping I'm not alone and theres someone out there who can relate?\\n\\nEdit - Sorry guys / gals I recieved a lot more responses than I thought. Thank you all so much. But I'm working and unable to reply.

When I was in college, I crushed pretty hard on one of my close girl friends. One day, I heard her say about me, \"He's so awkward and weird, I don't see how a woman could ever fall in love with him.\"\\n\\nNow in hindsight it doesn't feel so bad anymore, but at the time it crushed me.\\n\\n**edit after 250 upvotes -** I've been reading a good amount of your shares. damn. life and some close people have done y'all pretty rough. I'm not minimizing my own pain or anyone else's, cause each of us found those moments very painful regardless of what was done or said to you at the time. But I'm glad to hear that some of y'all have got the esteem and confidence and maturity to move on and learn. kudos to all of you, y'all are wonderful people and you deserve all the love.\\n\\n**edit after 1.3k upvotes -** goddamn. basically what I said during the 250 upvote edit still applies. But now, I can't help but be introspective. Have I ever been this mean and vicious about somebody? I don't specifically recall but if I have, I'm truly sorry. The trauma that words can cause people is just unacceptable, and if anything, I will make sure my conscience is clear henceforth. Stay strong and y'all keep staying beautiful.   \n",

I remember once a girl had a crush on me. I'm quite certain it was because of my dreads and skin color.\\n\\nThis girl I know well enough to know she always gets crushes on rappers and public figures. She also seems to have a fetish for black guys. Especially the gang-type or the rapper-type\\n\\nShe kinda lost that attraction for me when she realized I'm neither of those things (I'm a nerd lol).\\n\\nI wasn't upset or anything, but I had my share of questions until I put the pieces together\\n\\nWhat about you guys?\\n\\nEdit: Oh yeah, once I was sexting with a girl (I know, incredibly foolish thing to do at my age).\\n\\nBut she kept asking me to do a bunch of shit that I didn't want to do. Finger my ass, cum on my own face, do stuff with other guys. (Like jerk them off or get jerked off by them)\\n\\nWhenever I objected because I am a straight male, she came out and started accusing me of being homophobic. I'm homophobic because A. I'm not gay and B. I have sexual boundaries? Got it, that makes total sense /s\\n\\nI later learned this same person possessed child pornography. I'm glad I stopped talking to her. Incredibly fucked up individual (But it seems like it might stem from some sort of trauma)   \n",

My left lung collapsed and I was breathing off 20% of my right. I had a very low chance of survival. However BEFORE this diagnosis, my Mum was told after the initial hospital stay that I was “stable” and to go home with me. Mum point blank refused saying she knows her own child, and instead sat with me for hours in the waiting room. I became blue and unconscious and was eventually put on oxygen in the NICU. The doctor had to apologise to my Mum for repeatedly ignoring her. I was later on the news about pneumonia in babies and the symptoms.</td>\n",

I feel like right now is specifically hard for single ladies. Being in lock down alone (or even if you are with people, alone romantically) is hard.

Good to see we’re mostly all managing to keep ourselves fed and hydrated one way or another 💙\\n\\nEdit 2: I've seen a few people say they're saving this post, which is amazing! I didn't expect this response at all!  \\n\\nI thought it might be helpful to put a little list of some common answers/easy meals here that I've seen if anyone's struggling and needs something minimum effort...\\n\\n1) Meal replacement shakes/protein shakes/smoothies/tinned soup  \\nSuper quick, gets some nutrients in, ultimate minimum effort! \\n\\n2) Beans on toast! \\nA UK staple/easy meal of champions.  Add cheese (and Worcestershire sauce/hot sauce) if you're feeling up to it! \\n\\n3) Double up cooking when you're feeling good! \\nStick those extra portions in the freezer and just whack 'em in the microwave\\n\\n4) Easy quesadilla!  \\nTwo tortilla wraps with some cheese (and whatever else you fancy) in the middle, stick it in the microwave and you're good to go\\n\\n5) Peanut butter.  \\nOn a fork, on a spoon, on an apple, in a PBJ sandwich, added to a protein shake....just, peanut butter. \\n\\n6) Fried rice.  \\nI saw a great tip (not sure who from, sorry, but I'll try and find it!) who recommended ordering some extra portions of rice in a takeaway because it's quick and easy!\\n\\n7) Pasta!  Cook loads at once if you need to. Add pesto, or a jar of sauce, or a tin of tuna, or just some cheese. Whatever you have.\\n\\n8) Cereal\\n\\n9) Eggs\\nEasy to boil, peel and eat.

I’m struggling and have done for a long time to be taken seriously enough/get tested for something I have every symptom of. I understand this is a major problem for a lot of women in particular and I wondered what your experiences are?\\n\\nEdit: Thought of a story from being very young - at 2 weeks old I was in hospital for pneumonia and bronchiolitis. My left lung collapsed and I was breathing off 20% of my right. I had a very low chance of survival. However BEFORE this diagnosis, my Mum was told after the initial hospital stay that I was “stable” and to go home with me. Mum point blank refused saying she knows her own child, and instead sat with me for hours in the waiting room. I became blue and unconscious and was eventually put on oxygen in the NICU. The doctor had to apologise to my Mum for repeatedly ignoring her. I was later on the news about pneumonia in babies and the symptoms.   \n",

When did this happen? I’ve seen comments in every funny video (or intended to be funny) people (mostly men) saying that it isn’t funny, I obviously I get that you can find it not funny, but it’s not just that it’s always something like “hilarious 😐” or “Yeah, women aren’t funny” I’ve seen it in almost every post when there’s a woman trying to do a joke, in english speaking pages and in spanish too (I’m latina) and those are always the comments with most likes. I just don’t get it, like at all, it’s frustrating.   \n",

I'll start by saying I'm generally a high-anxiety person and COVID/WFH has made it worse in a lot of ways. I also have had a lot less energy in the past year than I did before. \\n\\nEither way, I run into this situation at least once a week: I feel in a weird headspace and I can't focus. Maybe I get a few small tasks done, but I can't make any progress harder tasks (ones that require creativity, thinking, good research). Sometimes I end up laying in bed to try and feel better or I just end up trying to catch up on the weekend. \\n\\nIs anyone else experiencing this? How do you handle it? It's kind of easy to feel like you're the only one going through this level of executive dysfunction.   \n",

I'd be fully erect just sitting beside a girl in my teens and now I'm 30 and have trouble maintaining an erection while I'm inside someone. I would hang out with girls just for their company and now its just to try and have sex just for the sake of having sex.\\n\\nPorn has made me so toxic in relationships, I just want to go back to the guy who enjoys the company of others rather than a guy trying to bang the hottest freak he can. I met a girl and been so busy trying to impress her, I haven't really had time to watch porn and obsess about sex. I think I'm going to give it up completely.</td>\n",

       "      <td>My best friend lost a bunch of weight and now he's expecting women to go crazy for him, yet they aren't because he became the ultimate nice guy in a Chad body. How do I bring this up without sounding like an asshole? Before losing weight, he treated women well and had a normal And healthy mindset. Now, he almost expects attractive women to want to date with him and gets extremely upset when they turn him down. Extremely upset as in \"going to the basement and punching a pillow for God knows how long\". He no longer wants to have female friends (another change) unless they dating, saying \"why do I have to keep up with a bitchy woman if I'm not fucking her?\". Also if we're out and he sees a cute girl walking alone, he's like I'll go ask her out, which I've stopped him from doing because it's a bit much to get asked out when you're shopping for groceries. He follows people on tiktok and Facebook who have been getting arrested for radical views and he's been reflecting that as well. How do I snap him out of this?\\n\\nEDIT: I'm talking to a mutual friend that's attending the same PhD program and she said there's a girl in class that keeps hyping up his toxic masculinity and she tells him he's the most masculine man she's met. The only time he's told me about her is when he said there's a girl in class that's not worth asking out bc \"she's too fat\" . I think that accounts for the sudden change in behavior over the last 2 months.\\n\\nUpdate: I hung out with him before he travels back to the city he studies at. Brought up a lot of points mentioned here: I asked about steroids and he denied it like his life depended on it, and said it's a compliment I said he's on steroids. I mentioned his mindset and how it won't get him into a healthy relationship, and he said dudes that are jacked get away with anything, which I said no and that was a whole argument. I brought up how saying you're alpha doesn't really mean anything and labeling people in happy relationships as betas is kinda fucked up, he said his dad was alpha and got a lot of women to sleep with him and his dad calls him alpha whenever they talk on the phone (so he's viewing it as a positive thing since his role model, his dad, is calling him that). His dad hates his sister's husband and calls him beta, seems like my buddy learned a few things from his old man. I brought up the girl he talks to in class that calls him masculine, and he said ya she's cool but she won't be anything more than a friend unless she loses at least 20 pounds. Also, he said he stopped watching porn/stopped jacking off so he feels incredibly tense all the time. He said that's something he's noticed and how his personality has been changing since he stopped jacking off. Lastly, I asked about all the \"hot girls he asked out\" and 3 of them have agreed to meet with him for coffee (together, so 4 people hanging out) once he flies back to the city his PhD program is @. Apperently a few texted him happy new year and things went good over text. \\n\\nAnywho, I think this is beyond me and there's noway I can fix whatever is happening here. I think psychological help would tackle some issues he's experiencing. I sent him this post but he called it stupid and refused to read it (at least I tried). Gonna start distancing myself because I feel like this is going nowhere but down. Just thought I'd update for those who wanted it. Thanks for all the advice, I appreciate it. And sorry to a lot of you I simply couldn't get through the sheer mass of comments to respond to every single one.</td>\n",

Straight or gay, I love boosting their confidence and letting them know how attractive they are.

He seemed pretty weirded out by it and his girlfriend (I think) looked up at him with a “wtf...?” Type of smirk as if I asked to suck his dick and that really annoyed me. \\n\\nIs it that weird to give other men compliments? I don’t come off as too “gay” either (which I don’t think should make a difference anyways). I’m really not looking to get anything out it (with maybe an exception or two.

It’s very addictive. It becomes a habit after you realize how calm and peaceful it is.

I've been reading posts about it and I'm starting to think I've been a porn addict since my early teens. I know a lot of other guys too who I'm sure are addicted.\\n\\n I remember before I started heavily abusing it and myself I had 0 expectations and such a strong sex drive. I'd be fully erect just sitting beside a girl in my teens and now I'm 30 and have trouble maintaining an erection while I'm inside someone. I would hang out with girls just for their company and now its just to try and have sex just for the sake of having sex.\\n\\nPorn has made me so toxic in relationships, I just want to go back to the guy who enjoys the company of others rather than a guy trying to bang the hottest freak he can. I met a girl and been so busy trying to impress her, I haven't really had time to watch porn and obsess about sex. I think I'm going to give it up completely.\n",
       "2    My best friend lost a bunch of weight and now he's expecting women to go crazy for him, yet they aren't because he became the ultimate nice guy in a Chad body. How do I bring this up without sounding like an asshole? Before losing weight, he treated women well and had a normal And healthy mindset. Now, he almost expects attractive women to want to date with him and gets extremely upset when they turn him down. Extremely upset as in \"going to the basement and punching a pillow for God knows how long\". He no longer wants to have female friends (another change) unless they dating, saying \"why do I have to keep up with a bitchy woman if I'm not fucking her?\". Also if we're out and he sees a cute girl walking alone, he's like I'll go ask her out, which I've stopped him from doing because it's a bit much to get asked out when you're shopping for groceries. He follows people on tiktok and Facebook who have been getting arrested for radical views and he's been reflecting that as well. How do I snap him out of this?\\n\\nEDIT: I'm talking to a mutual friend that's attending the same PhD program and she said there's a girl in class that keeps hyping up his toxic masculinity and she tells him he's the most masculine man she's met. The only time he's told me about her is when he said there's a girl in class that's not worth asking out bc \"she's too fat\" . I think that accounts for the sudden change in behavior over the last 2 months.\\n\\nUpdate: I hung out with him before he travels back to the city he studies at. Brought up a lot of points mentioned here: I asked about steroids and he denied it like his life depended on it, and said it's a compliment I said he's on steroids. I mentioned his mindset and how it won't get him into a healthy relationship, and he said dudes that are jacked get away with anything, which I said no and that was a whole argument. I brought up how saying you're alpha doesn't really mean anything and labeling people in happy relationships as betas is kinda fucked up, he said his dad was alpha and got a lot of women to sleep with him and his dad calls him alpha whenever they talk on the phone (so he's viewing it as a positive thing since his role model, his dad, is calling him that). His dad hates his sister's husband and calls him beta, seems like my buddy learned a few things from his old man. I brought up the girl he talks to in class that calls him masculine, and he said ya she's cool but she won't be anything more than a friend unless she loses at least 20 pounds. Also, he said he stopped watching porn/stopped jacking off so he feels incredibly tense all the time. He said that's something he's noticed and how his personality has been changing since he stopped jacking off. Lastly, I asked about all the \"hot girls he asked out\" and 3 of them have agreed to meet with him for coffee (together, so 4 people hanging out) once he flies back to the city his PhD program is @. Apperently a few texted him happy new year and things went good over text. \\n\\nAnywho, I think this is beyond me and there's noway I can fix whatever is happening here. I think psychological help would tackle some issues he's experiencing. I sent him this post but he called it stupid and refused to read it (at least I tried). Gonna start distancing myself because I feel like this is going nowhere but down. Just thought I'd update for those who wanted it. Thanks for all the advice, I appreciate it. And sorry to a lot of you I simply couldn't get through the sheer mass of comments to respond to every single one.\n",

As a gay man, I love throwing compliments at men. Straight or gay, I love boosting their confidence and letting them know how attractive they are. Again, in a non sexual way. \\n\\nI was at Starbucks one time and I complimented this dudes coat and asked him where he got it from. He seemed pretty weirded out by it and his girlfriend (I think) looked up at him with a “wtf...?” Type of smirk as if I asked to suck his dick and that really annoyed me. \\n\\nIs it that weird to give other men compliments? I don’t come off as too “gay” either (which I don’t think should make a difference anyways). I’m really not looking to get anything out it (with maybe an exception or two. Hey, I’m human!) \\n\\nBut yeah... what are your thoughts? \\n\\nAlso message me if you want a confidence boost ❤️ or don’t, if you don’t like that...\\n\\nI just want everyone to be happy \\n\\nEdit: also I guess the title of “when a gay guy compliments you” is irrelevant.. I mean just a guy in general.\n",

I'm in a first time relationship, and I'm not sure what to call him. I don't want him to feel too feminine, but I don't want our relationship to seem businesslike.

I literally have no idea what I’m doing anymore. I always had a plan, and now I have nothing. Is this relatable? What helped?\\n\\nEdit for context: (F23), graduating with a communications degree this fall. I am not a fan of the jobs I can get with this degree (PR, HR, social media)... They make my soul wither. I want to live a meaningful life where I can help people realize their best selves, as I've done a lot of unpacking myself. Becoming a clinical counsellor, however, appears to be an arduous journey. \\nAlso, I want to move away from all the crap going on in the world, into the trees, away from all the capitalistic bullshit and have a humble home with chickens.

Personally, I've been sexually assaulted and have PTSD. My big thing is that I wish people didn't constantly assume I want to fuck.\\n\\nThe whole \"men have two moods: hungry and horny\" is extremely damaging for male SA survivors, even men in general, because it's generally expected that we won't say no.\n",

In the end does it really matter as long as you are happy? Or does wealth outweigh happiness for you? Men, how have you all successfully made it in life? I’m 22 years old and I feel like my life has no meaning. What am I worth? How can I make myself worth something to be happy about?

For the past couple of years my wife has had contstant health issues ranging from physical to mental.  Her energy is usually low and I want to know how I can best care for her, let her know how much she means to me. Any ideas just to alleviate her mind and body in any way I can would be appreciated.\\n\\nEdit: thank you all for the wonderful advice and awards!!\n",

The difference between random forest and bagging is that while bagging takes a random sample of the documents in a dataset, random forest further narrows down that subset by randomly selecting a set of features when considering the split. By doing so, the random forest reduces structural similarities between each tree and thus addresses the issues of multicollinearity that may create biasness."

    "Random forest is significantly better at classifying AskMen topics than AskWomen topics, which may be alot more relevant to the Tinder audience as Tinder has alot more male audience that it does women. Unfortunately, when using this model, we are unable to differentiate the feature importance by class. One interesting finding here is that since the model is good at predicting AskMen posts, we find that alot of our features with higher coefficients are features that classifies the review. "
