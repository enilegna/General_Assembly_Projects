## Introduction
The Ames Assesor's Office house has gotten a call from the Iowa local government saying that it needed to cut costs. In looking at its financial reports, they realized that alot of their costs were spent on collecting data. The Ames City assessor also has dilema as these data collection are used by the tax authority to estimate property prices and its appropriate tax levies. 

In this project, we are trying to create a model that can accurately predict house prices in the city of Ames, located within Story County, Iowa United States to allow users to estimate their house prices. Using data we have obtained from the Ames Assesor's Office house and machine learning models, we will assess the predictive performance of Linear, Lasso and Ridge Regression models in finding accurate prices based on pre-selected features. 

The model with the best predictive performance will be used for our Sale Price prediction and uploaded into [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dsi-us-6-project-2-regression-challenge/leaderboard#score) for a competition between the Ames office and the Tax authorities. They have submitted their score of 35,000 and have urged us to submit ours as soon as possible!

## Problem Statement

Our goal is to find the best machine learning model that can accurately predict house prices for the tax authority minimize the variables in the dataset so that we no longer need to collect so much data in the coming year thus reducing cost.

Models Assessed: Linear, Lasso and Ridge
Scoring: Root Mean Squared Error
Stakeholders: The Ames City Assesor

## Conclusions

In this project, we managed to reduce the current 81 features of the housing data set to only 24 features. Should the Ames County find that this number of features is too much, they may consider to reduce features that least impact prices, base don the coefficients of the Ridge Regression model. For instance, Exterior 1st Vinyl/Cement and MS SubClass can be removed as they have lower coefficients. 

We have found out that there is no need to have fine granularity in data gathering, instead of getting the porch area, we can simply get developers to tell us whether the house has a porch or not. We can also reduce the complexity of the survey by combining questions like no. of full baths above ground and no. of full baths in basement to a simple, total full baths. 

Things like half baths can be taken out entirely from the survey as it does not have any correlation to Sale Price and thus also to tax prices.
